# Purrrpley's Userstyles

Welcome to my repository of userstyles :)

Userstyles are custom CSS files that can be loaded by a userstyles manager like [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html), granting the user full control over their browser and how websites are displayed.

These are personally created by me for me, but I'm sharing them for your convenience and because I like sharing my work. I don't guarantee they'll work perfectly and be maintained and updated forever, but you probably didn't think that. If you find something broken, you can [report an issue](https://github.com/Purrrpley/userstyles/issues/) and I'll probably try to fix it. I don't want to spend my life creating custom userstyles for people, so please don't request I make one for you.

# How to Install

To install a userstyle from this repository:

1. Install a userstyles manager addon.
    * Stylus (recommended): [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/stylus/>)
    * Stylish (abandoned, spyware): Don't use it. I'm not linking it here. Just letting you know to avoid it.
    * There's [quite a few alternatives](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Stylish-alternatives) if you don't want to use Stylus for some reason.
2. Find and open the userstyle you want. Their filenames should be descriptive enough, and at the top of the files in a comment should be a proper name and description, so it shouldn't be too hard to find. If you're here, you probably know what you're looking for.
3. Click "raw" on the right of the file header. This will let you view the file without the extra GitHub UI around it.
4. Your userstyle manager should recognised the file as a userstyle and give you the option to install and configure it.

# What about [userstyles.world](https://userstyles.world/)?

There's a few websites dedicated to the sharing of userstyles, but I don't share my userstyles there. I'll probably put them there at some point, though at the moment I don't want to deal with that.
